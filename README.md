# 2D-Interactive-Maps
An interactive map was created to analyse the effect of floods in 2018 in the state of Kerala.  Different layers are created for the web map and the layers are: Flood_Intensity, Bulding_Damaged, Health_Services, Roads_Km, Livelihood. The map was created then hosted on the geoserver and was visualized in the browser.
